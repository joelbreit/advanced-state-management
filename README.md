# Project Management App

This is was an app I made for practice with React and web development based on "Section 10: React's Context API & useReducer - Advanced State Management" from [this tutorial](https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-course-resources). It let's you add and remove some example items to a cart and view the total price of the items in the cart. It is a helpful reference for using the React Context API and useReducer.

## Run the Project

1. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
2. Run the project with `npm run dev`
